I loved the sound of the instrumental and whole concept of their music style and have always been inspired by the vocal styles used by many different and great vocalists including Will Ramos of Lorna Shore, Ryan Vail of Larcenia Roe, Nicolas TFB of Ruins of Perception, Alex Terrible of Slaughter to Prevail, Lukas Nicolai of Mental Cruelty, etc… I have always loved how certain vocal styles blended with the instrumental of different bands adds loads of different emotions to their songs and have wanted to be able to achieve that myself by being a vocalist for a band and for myself as well."

                             <h3> "I started playing guitar when I was around 14 years old, because of players such as Vai, Marty Friedman, and Dimebag Darrel. Around the time I started playing was the same time that Polyphia had released their album 'Remember That You Will Die' which of course was very popular at the time it came out, and I was introduced to it by my dad. I was blown away, having grown up around a lot of music such as metal, R&B, pop, etc. It was a sound I had never heard before. A little later on, I discovered artists like Manual Gardner Fernandes, Jakub Zytecki, and Sleep Token, and since then I have developed a much broader taste in music, and I try to incorporate different elements from these styles to try to express as uniquely as possible, and I constantly strive to be the best musician I can possibly be."

These guys and the styles they write, but also their respective guitar tones all kinda combined to make what I like to play, I just wish I could do it as good as them. I also am largely inspired by Thrash metal, specifically Megadeth, and a bit of Metallica."
